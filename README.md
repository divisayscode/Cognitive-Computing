# Cognitive Computing (Course Project)

This repository contains my assignments and projects from the **Cognitive Computing** course, where I used Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit‑learn**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **NLTK** to explore topics in data processing, visualization, and natural language analysis.

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- **NumPy** – numeric computations and array handling  
- **Pandas** – data loading, cleaning, and manipulation  
- **Scikit‑learn** – machine learning models and preprocessing  
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** – data visualization  
- **NLTK** – text processing and language analysis
